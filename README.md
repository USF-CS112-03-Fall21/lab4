#  Lab 4
In this lab, you need to manipulate an image that is stored in a two-dimensional structure similar to a 2D array ("Picture"). 
Each element of this 2D structure is called a pixel and is referenced by its (x, y) coordinates (first we specify the column, then the row). The color of each pixel has three components (r, g, b): red, green and blue. In this assignment, we assume these components are integers and range from 0 to 255. (255, 0, 0) represents the red color, without any green or blue in it; (0, 255, 0) represents the green color, and (255, 255, 255) represents the white color. Classes Pixel and Picture have been implemented by Richard Wicentowski and Tia Newhall.  You do not need to modify them.
See the pdf of the lab for the description of the methods you need to implement.
